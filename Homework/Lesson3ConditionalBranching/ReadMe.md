Basic operators, maths
Comparisons
Conditional branching: if, '?'
Logical operators
Nullish coalescing operator '??'
Homework Requirement:
Create two files in your js-training project and name one ConditionalBranchingIf.js and the other one TernaryOperator.js
Paste the full homework requirements (tasks) into your corresponding file. (You can find the homework requirements in the attached files)
Complete all the tasks in both of the files.
Push your files to the remote repository by following these steps:
git add ConditionalBranching.js TernaryOperator.js/ git add .
git commit -m "Lesson 3: ConditionalBranching"
git push origin
Hand in(Submit) the homework.
Note: 
For the tasks in the ConditionalBranchingIf.js file, use only conditional branching (if).
For the tasks in the TernaryOperator.js file, write the code using both conditional branching (if) and the ternary operator(?).
How the homework will be graded:
You have two files: one with 4 tasks(ConditionalBranchingIf.js) and the other with 2 tasks(TernaryOperator.js), so you have a total of 6 tasks.
The total grade is 30, meaning each task is worth 5 points. If you have even one mistake in a task, the grade for that task will be 0, as it is considered that your code is incorrect.
