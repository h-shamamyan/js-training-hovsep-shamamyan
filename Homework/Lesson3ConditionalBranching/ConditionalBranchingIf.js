// Task 2: Grade Calculator

// 80-89 → B
// 70-79 → C

// Task 5: Weekend Checker
// Ask the user to enter a day of the week (e.g., "Monday", "Saturday").
// Print "It's the weekend!" if it's Saturday or Sunday, otherwise print "It's a weekday".
// Write your code here

// Task4: Game Score Adjuster
// Problem Statement:
// You are developing a simple game where the player starts with 10 points.
// If they answer a question correctly, their score increases by 1 (++).
// If they answer incorrectly, their score decreases by 1 (--).
// The program should check if the player’s score has reached 0 and print "Game Over" if true.
// Steps to Implement:
// Initialize score = 10.
// Ask the user if their answer is correct (true/false).
// Use if-else with ++ and -- to update the score.
// If the score reaches 0, print "Game Over".
// Otherwise, print the updated score.
// Write your code here
