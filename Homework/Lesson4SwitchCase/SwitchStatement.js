// Task 1: Basic Calculator
// Objective:
// Create a simple calculator that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input, then performs the corresponding mathematical operation using a switch statement.

// Steps:

//  1. Ask the user to enter the first number. Convert it to a number type if necessary.
//  2. Request the user to enter an operator (+, -, *, /).
//  3. Require the user to enter the second number.
//  4. Use a switch statement to check the operator and perform the corresponding operation:
//  5. If +, add the two numbers.
//  6. If -, subtract the second number from the first.
//  7. If *, multiply the two numbers.
//  8. If /, divide the first number by the second (ensure no division by zero).
//  9. Display the result of the calculation.
// 10. If the user enters an invalid operator, show an error message.

// Task 2: Season Finder
// Objective:
// Write a program that takes the name of a month and logs which season it belongs to (Winter, Spring, Summer, or Fall).

// Steps:

//  1. Request the user to enter a month name (e.g., January, February).
//  2. Use a switch statement to check the month and log the season(e.g. if Jamuary is entered log "Winter"):
//  3. Winter: December, January, February
//  5. Spring: March, April, May
//  6. Summer: June, July, August
//  7. Autumn: September, October, November
//  8. Log the corresponding season.
//  9. If the user enters an invalid month name, log "Invalid month! Please enter a valid month name."

// Task 3: Determine the Age Group
// Objective:
// Write a program that takes an age as input and determines which age group the person belongs to using switch(true).

// Steps:

//  1. Request the user to enter their age.
//  2. Use a switch(true) statement to evaluate the age and categorize it into one of the following groups:
//     -If the age is less than 0, print "Invalid age".
//     -If the age is between 0 and 12 (inclusive), print "Child".
//     -If the age is between 13 and 17 (inclusive), print "Teenager".
//     -If the age is between 18 and 64 (inclusive), print "Adult".
//     -If the age is 65 or older, print "Senior".
//  3. If the user enters a non-numeric value, print "Please enter a valid age."
