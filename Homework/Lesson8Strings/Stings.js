// Task 1: Get String Length
// Requirement: Write a function that receives
// a string as input and returns the length of the string.
// Write your code here!

// Task 2: Print Each Character
// Requirement: Write a function that receives a string and prints each character on a new line.
// The function should validate that the input is a string and that its length is between 1 and 50 characters.
// If the input is invalid, display an appropriate message.
// Write your code here!

// Task 3: Capitalize Name and Surname
// Requirement: Write a function that receives a string containing a name and surname.
// The function should convert the first letter of the name and surname to uppercase
// and return the updated string.
// The function should also validate that the input is a string and contains exactly two parts (name and surname).
// Write your code here!

// Task 4: Alternate Case
// Requirement: Write a function that receives a string with a minimum length of 10
// and a maximum length of 20 characters.
// The function should return the string with characters alternated between uppercase and lowercase.
// For example, "test" should become "TeSt".
// If the string length is outside the specified range, display an appropriate message.
// Write your code here!

// Task 5: Check Palindrome
// Requirement: Write a function that receives a string and checks if the string is a palindrome
// (i.e., the string is the same forwards and backwards).
// The function should return true if the string is a palindrome and false otherwise.
// Ignore spaces and punctuation.
// Example:
// Input: "racecar"
// Output: true
// Explanation: The string "racecar" is the same forwards and backwards, so the output is true.
// Write your code here!

// Task 10: Count Specific Character in String
// Requirement: Write a function that receives two values: a main string and a character.
// The function should return how many times the specified character appears in the string.
// Write your code here!
